					<h3>Logo</h3>
					<p>The logo shown at the top of the website is pixelated and difficult to understand what it is. There are three different colored illustrations of people in kayaks/canoes. This logo could be improved if it was higher quality and designed as a higher dpi vector image that can scale without losing any quality.</p>
					<h3>Website</h3>
					<p>Canoeing for Kids' website is currently not optimal for viewers. It does not fill the window at full screen and does not scale with the size of the window. It also does not have a mobile-friendly version to increase legibility on a smaller screen.</p>
					<p>The photos on the website are low quality and some are so pixelated that the content cannot be clearly understood. There are also random image titles listed as captions below the images that don't seem to have any form of organization.</p>

					<h3>Facebook Page</h3>
					<p>There are a limited number of marketing materials and advertising graphics shown on the Facebook page. The few that were posted appear to be created using Instagram or Facebook, or possibly a free template creator such as Canva or another app. The typefaces used are not cohesive and do not reflect the brand identity.</p>
					<p>The photos posted on Facebook are much more clear and higher quality than those posted on the website. These images could still use some work to make them more professional and finished, but they reflect the brand better and make it seem more established.</p>

					<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/nonprofit-fundraising-in-the-age-of-coronavirus">This article</a> from the Harvard Business Review discusses what issues non-profits are facing during the time of Covid-19 in relation to their funding. It can come across as insensitive to ask for monetary donations when so many people are struggling both medically and financially, but non-profit businesses still need donations to stay afloat in such unexpected times. The article gave the example of what the YMCA did, which was sending out a message to members offering a month of free membership because they understood the situation that people are in and wanted to continue to have a long-term relationship with members rather than losing them due to financial struggles. They also mentioned in this message that if anyone had the extra income and wanted to donate to help their business, it would be greatly appreciated. This strategy is personal in that is shows a knowledge and understanding of the financial situation of many people right now, while still providing an avenue to potentially still receive donations to help them continue running their business.</p>

					<p>According to <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-underprivileged-children/5403">this article</a> from WalletHub, South Carolina has the 13th highest percentage of underprivileged children in the country. They rank #6 for health and #11 for education. With such a high percentage of underprivileged children in the state, there are so many opportunities for groups to take trips with Canoeing for Kids.</p>

					<p>The above <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/12-dos-donts-web-design-2/">article</a> from Adobe lists and explains some key tips for having professional and effective website design. It has things that both should and shouldn't be done on websites to make them the most user-friendly. A few of the key tips mentioned were easy-to-use navigation, using common language that can be easily understood, and having a responsive website.</p>

						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">Insight from potential users of the site</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>I had a difficult time finding people to interview for this portion of the research. I reached out to the organization, but did not receive a response back. I also reached out to a few organizations that have partnered with Canoeing for Kids in the past the I saw posts about on Instagram, Congaree River Keeper, River Runner, and Soda City SC. The only person I heard back from was Lydia at Soda City SC. She told me the person who posted a feature about Canoeing for Kids on the Soda City SC Instagram page a few years back was no longer at their organization, so she could not be of any more assistance to me. After the lack of responses from the other places I reached out to, I contacted a few people I know who could be potential volunteers with this organization and decided to interview them.</p>
					<h3>Volunteer - Parker Whittle</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/interview1.jpg" alt="photo of Parker" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>Parker is a Columbia native who is currently a freshman at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. He plays baseball for Winthrop and is pursuing a major in exercise science. Parker loves spending time outdoors and has experience with activities that include canoeing, kayaking, and fishing.</p></div>

					<h5>What would you visit this website for?</h5>
					<p>Looking for somewhere to volunteer</p>
					<h5>What information would you want to know? (about page, hours, contact info, etc.)</h5>
					<p>I'd be looking for proof that this is a well-run, loving, and safety-focused organization that really cares for the kids that participate.</p>
					<h5>Can you tell me some specific things you'd look for to do that? (about page, photo gallery, etc.)</h5>
					<p>I'd really love to see an about page with some background, especially like a mission statement and goals for each trip. The photo gallery would also be amazing to see, as we know pictures are worth a thousand words. Past that, any other parts of the website that focus on communication and prioritizing safety.</p>
					<h5>What are your initial thoughts about this organization based on the current website?</h5>
					<p>I feel llike it's definitely outdated and probably doesn't portray what the organization really is about. A newer page would do a better job of impressing potential visitors with a good presentation, and that could help them have a bigger impact in the community.</p>
					<h5>What, if anything, do you think is working/successful about the website?</h5>
					<p>I love the history page, there's a lot of detail and heart put into it that conveys a love for the children they work with. I like the concept of the photo gallery they have, but the pictures inside are so outdated they can barely be seen--if this was updated it would be a great feature.</p>
					<h5>What, if anything, do you think needs the most work on the website?</h5>
					<p>I would say the overall visual presentation needs the most improvement. The information inside and the love for the job is there, but the website is so outdated it doesn't catch the attention of the viewer. A solid redesign and some new pictures would be completely revolutionary.</p>
					<h3>Volunteer - Kayla Prevatte</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/interview2.jpg" alt="photo of Parker" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>Kayla is a recent Anderson graduate that is also from the Columbia area. She is currently a teacher assistant at Riverbank Elementary School in West Columbia, South Carolina. Kayla loves the outdoors and is passionate about all children having the equal opportunity to experience hands-on learning.</p></div>
					</div>
					<h5>What would you visit this website for?</h5>

					<ul>

					</ul>
					<h5>What are your initial thoughts about this organization based on the current website?</h5>

						<li>Not easy to use on a phone</li>
						<li>Small icons</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>What, if anything, do you think is working/successful about the website?</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Seems to have reliable links</li>
						<li>I know they have success based on their 20 year line ("now celebrating 20 years of smiling children's faces")</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>What, if anything, do you think needs the most work on the website?</h5>
					<p>Home page - does NOT sell it at first glance</p>
