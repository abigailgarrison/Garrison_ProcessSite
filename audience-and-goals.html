					<h3>Audience</h3>
					<p>I started broad when thinking about the different audiences of my chosen organization and then gradually narrowed it down into more categories. The main categories include those who are directly affected, people who assist with the organization, and those who are peripherally involved or affected.</p>
					<p>The first category is people who are directly affected by the organization. Within this, there is the category of people who benefit, which would be underprivileged children in the area. Organizations that work with children such as children's homes are another audience directly affected by the organization, even though the organizations themselves do not directly benefit.</p>
					<p>The next category is people who assist with the organization. This is divided into two groups: volunteers and donors/funding. Potential volunteers include teachers, other parents, college students, and people with a high interest in canoeing and kayaking. Potential donors/funding avenues include churches, local businesses, individuals with an interest in the organization, outdoor and adventure stores, supportive community members (fundraiser participants for Raft-A-Rama, private trips, and Christmas tree sales), and the current sponsors (Adventure Carolina, L.R. Hook Tire Co., Allegra Print and Imaging, River Runner, O.B. One Communications, Powell Electrical, Palmetto Outdoors, Arnold's Auto Parts, Outsource Financial, and Dillsboro River Company).</p>
					<p>The final audience category is those who are peripherally involved or affected. Within this category are fans, skeptics, and other peripherally relevant audiences. Fans would include adventurers, kayaking and outdoors stores and organizations, teachers (particularly science teachers), people who support hands-on learning, people who support children having outdoor learning experiences, media and news outlets, and possibly social workers. There aren't as many audiences that would be skeptics or potential challenges to this organization. Foster parents may be concerned about sending the children on kayaking trips for liability and safety concerns and government employees working in the parks and recreation department may have concerns about the safety of these trips depending on the number of children and adults, as well as the children's knowledge of how to kayak/canoe safely. There are a few other peripherally relevant audiences that don't fit into either of the other two groups. These audiences include parents of the children going on trips, financial donors to the organizations that take trips with Canoeing for Kids, and the local foster care system. Teachers and parks and recreation employees also fit in this category because it affects them in terms of more than just their opinion.
