					<h4>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h4>
					<p>Providing free canoeing and kayaking trips for underprivileged children.</p>
					<h4>1. Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</h4>
					<p>How can the website promote fundraisers so they can benefit more children?</p>
					<h4>2. Now state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h4>
					<p>Increase funding for trips and reach qualifying groups to provide free trips to.</p>
					<h4>3. What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h4>
					<h6>Think broadly. It's fine to start a project with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprising outcomes.</h6>
					<p>High quality images, recognizable logo and branding, scalable website, CTA donation button on home page.</p>
					<h4>4. Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing.</h4>
					<h6>They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you're trying to reach.</h6>
					<p>Small organization in Lexington, SC; only has two fundraisers throughout the year to involve the public; difficult to provide service year-round due to weather concerns.</p>
					<h4>5. Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h4>
					<p>How can the website be more effectively and professionally designed to reach more of the local population and increase funding?</p>
